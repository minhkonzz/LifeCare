Unfortunately, modern nutrition and lifestyle habits have destroyed this flexibility for the majority of people. Specifically, the foods people are eating and the timeframe in which they’re eating them have shifted in the wrong direction — and as a result, humans are now burning a lot more sugar and a lot less fat.\n\nHowever, if you want to lose fat — which is what most people hope for when trying to lose weight — then fat is the fuel you need to be burning! So, let’s explore how to reignite your body’s natural ability to burn fat." },

This energy is initially derived from the foods we consume, which are predominantly made up of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.\n\nWhile the body can technically convert all three of these fuels into energy, some are more preferable than others. Amino acids, for example, are primarily used for tissue repair and synthesis. In times of need, they can be modified and funneled into various parts of the metabolic pathway to produce energy; however, since the body would rather conserve these compounds for maintenance and growth of lean body mass to keep you healthy, fatty acids and glucose are what it most often burns for fuel." },

               { k: "desc", v: "Glucose, derived from dietary carbohydrates, is often dubbed the body’s “preferred” fuel source since it provides a quick and efficient source of energy. It is metabolized through a rapid process called glycolysis to eventually produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule that provides energy for most cellular functions. Any excess glucose can be stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen or converted to fat and stored for later use.\n\nFat, on the other hand, supplies a slower, sustained energy release. Whether consumed in food or stored as adipose tissue, fatty acids take longer to process for energy because they undergo a more intensive breakdown process that ultimately feeds into the same cycle to produce ATP. The breakdown of fatty acids can also produce ketones, which, in the absence of sufficient glucose, serve as an alternate fuel source for the brain and other tissues.\n\nWhich fuel your body prefers will depend upon your diet as well as your physiological needs, such as the type or intensity of exercise you are performing. While glucose is the standard go-to in a fed state and when you need a quick energy burst, the body taps into fat reserves for sustained endurance and during periods of fasting and carbohydrate scarcity. In essence, our bodies have evolved to efficiently use both, depending on the situation and supply." },

               { k: "desc", v: "Tapping into your fat reserves for energy provides a whole host of health benefits. One of the standout advantages of burning fat is enhanced metabolic flexibility. Simply put, this means your body can more easily switch between using glucose and fatty acids for fuel. This “metabolic superpower” ensures you remain energized when carbs are in short supply, during a fast, or even in your typical day-to-day grind.\n\nWhen you increase your metabolic flexibility, you increase your ability to burn body fat — often a desired outcome when trying to lose weight. Instead of using fuel from food or glucose stored within the body, you are able to more readily tap into your fat stores. Healthy weight loss involves burning as much stored fat as possible for energy, thereby preserving lean body mass and improving body composition.\n\nUsing fat as a primary fuel source for energy and to decrease your total body fat can also have broader metabolic benefits and reduce your risk of chronic disease. As your body becomes adept at utilizing fat, it can lead to improved insulin sensitivity, decreased inflammation, and a reduction in visceral fat — all key players in type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. Overall, adopting a metabolic state where fat is used more readily for energy can pave the way for a healthier, more resilient body." },
               { k: "section_title", v: "How Do I Burn Fat Instead of Glucose?" },
               { k: "desc", v: "The human body regularly burns a mix of glucose and fat for energy, but the proportion of these fuels can be swayed by several factors, most notably fasting, nutrition, and exercise.\n\nWhen glucose is less available, such as during periods of fasting, the body turns to stored fat reserves for energy. After your last meal for the day, your body will go to work processing, digesting, and using that consumed fuel to produce energy. Once the nutrients from your last meal are gone, the body then taps into its storage tanks. The breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) tends to come first and is the preferred fuel source in a fasted state until about 12–36 hours into a fast, depending on how much your body has stored. After that, the metabolic switch “flips” and your body leans more heavily on fatty acids and ketones for energy production until you eat again.\n\nTo reduce the time it takes your body to start prioritizing fat, try eating fewer carbohydrates, especially in the meal immediately before you start your fast (generally before bed). Smaller, carbohydrate-conscious meals tend to keep glucose and insulin levels lower, speeding up the transition to burning fat. Maintaining a 2–4-hour gap between your last meal (or snack) and bedtime will also help you get quality sleep, which sets up your body for optimal fat burning. Studies have suggested that consistently getting 7–9 hours of sleep can result in better weight and fat loss and also reduces cravings or compensatory eating behavior, further supporting weight loss and maintenance.\n\nEngaging in regular physical activity, especially in a fasted state, further boosts the body’s capacity to use fat as a primary fuel. There are two reasons: First, exercise depletes your glycogen stores faster, thus increasing the speed at which you will need an alternative fuel (fat!) for energy. As exercise intensity increases, so does the demand for glucose — so, engaging in moderate-to-vigorous exercise such as HIIT or weight training will help deplete your glycogen stores and have your body reaching for fat sooner. Second, low-to-moderate-intensity exercise, such as walking at a fast pace or taking an easy bike ride, amplifies fat-burn rate because your body shifts its fuel mix towards peak fat burning. Shoot for at least 20–30 minutes of daily fasted movement to boost your fat-burning potential. Regularly mix in low-, moderate-, and high-intensity exercise in order to speed up both your glycogen depletion and fat oxidation, leading to quicker results and broader health benefits" },

This is an important distinction, because a weight of 200 lbs can have very different health implications for a person who is 5’3” compared to someone who is 6’3”.\n\nBMI works by classifying people into risk groups based on their normalized weight. To see where you fall, you can calculate your BMI by hand (body mass index = body weight in kg ÷ height in m2) or by using one of many free online calculators or app features. A BMI of 21-25 kg/m2 is considered “normal” or “healthy”.\n\nWhat’s important to know from a longevity standpoint is that in large, long-term studies, adults who fall within this “healthy” BMI range and whose weight stays stable over time also have the lowest disease and mortality risk. In a nutshell, life expectancy and disease-free healthspan are on average 7 years longer in women and 9 years longer in men who maintain stable healthy BMI throughout their adult lives.

A meta-analysis from 2014 concluded that older participants with BMI of 26-28.9 kg/m2 (as opposed to the standard “healthy” range of 21-25 kg/m2) minimized mortality risk. Several  hypotheses describe why this may be the case: for example, higher BMI may provide older adults with more stored energy to combat illnesses or protect them from injuries which may otherwise be life-threatening." },

               { k: "desc", v: "Although BMI is the current broad standard and can provide us insight on physical health in the general population, BMI unfortunately does not always serve individual humans well. While BMI is normalized by height, it does not account for individual differences in muscle or fat mass. As a result, BMI often misclassifies athletes who have increased muscle mass (which increases their weight but not their risk of chronic disease or death). In addition, BMI does not classify people equally across diverse groups because it was not created in a representative sample. (Quetelet created it using — as most researchers of his time did — the measurements of white Western Europeans.)\n\nIn addition, and probably most importantly, BMI does not provide any direct information about metabolism. Research demonstrates that many people with a BMI >30 kg/m2 (which the CDC classifies as obese) can can also be metabolically healthy. Metabolically healthy obese individuals have lower risk and higher longevity potential across their lifespan than normal weight metabolically unhealthy individuals. Put another way, metabolic health matters more than weight when it comes to healthspan and lifespan.\n\nBMI certainly isn’t perfect, as metabolic health is also clearly essential for assessing overall health and longevity. That said, BMI is superior to its “ideal body weight equation” predecessors. BMI is also less complicated (and less expensive) than measuring body composition, which requires specialized equipment, equations, and training. For most adults striving to extend healthspan and lifespan, BMI is an accessible way to assess health risk in relation to their body weight. This makes BMI a valuable tool for pursuing better health and longevity." }

Losing more than 2 pounds per week typically results from extreme changes such as drastically cutting your calorie consumption, eliminating a major food group, and/or exercising more often and more vigorously — practices that are hard to maintain over time.\n\nThe speed at which you lose weight may also predict your chances of regaining that weight back. Typically, the quicker the drop in weight, the higher your chances of gaining it back. Very low-calorie diets can lead to significant weight loss initially, with some studies showing an average of 17.9 kg (16%) weight loss in 6 months. However, the data show that most participants can’t maintain such a restrictive diet and regain the majority of that weight back within 36 months.\n\nPerhaps most worrisome is the fact that accelerated weight loss can lead to unintended health consequences such as loss of muscle and increased risk of nutrient deficiencies. In a study in the journal Obesity, 5 weeks of very low caloric consumption (~500 calories/day) resulted in significant loss of lean body mass (rather than the fat you want to be losing!). In addition, cutting out entire categories of foods can lead to nutrient deficiencies that negatively impact your energy, immunity, and cognition, and can even accelerate aging and increase your risk of chronic disease." },

As you lose weight, your energy expenditure can decrease, meaning you burn fewer calories at rest. This can often be a reason for plateaus in people’s weight-loss journeys. Additionally, gaining muscle — which weighs more than fat — can also look like “stalled progress” on the scale.

These hunter-gatherers might have a successful hunt every 1–2 weeks, meaning they often had to go days without food. In order to have enough energy in their next hunt (even after stretches of not eating), these humans developed metabolic flexibility. It was a distinct evolutionary advantage to be able to burn incoming glucose and store extra calories as fat during times of feasting, and then switch to accessing the energy from these stores (in the form of fatty acid and fatty-acid derived ketones) during times of famine.

However, if your body never flips the metabolic switch to burn fat, you miss out on many health and metabolic benefits, including weight loss, improvements in body composition, lower inflammation, less insulin resistance, better cardiovascular health, and more stable energy.\n\nFurthermore, the less often your body moves into fat burning, the more reliant on carbohydrates and less metabolically flexible it becomes. Being metabolically inflexible can lead to higher circulating glucose levels, resulting in the release of more insulin, the hormone responsible for ushering glucose into your cells. Over time, because your body has been subjected to so much insulin, it becomes less sensitive to this hormone (similar to the way you might tune out a loud sound if you hear it continuously), which can eventually lead to type-2 diabetes. Metabolic inflexibility can also negatively impact your ability to access fat stores for energy, which influences your weight, body composition, and energy levels.

In contrast, intermittent fasting allows your body to lower its blood glucose, deplete its glycogen, and “flip the metabolic switch,” transitioning your metabolism away from utilizing primarily glucose and towards oxidizing fat, otherwise known as the Fat-Burning Mode." },

It’s only in the last hundred years or so that modern conveniences have enabled round-the-clock eating every day of the week.

Because fasting is more tightly linked to fat burning and weight loss than physical activity or diet individually, this is the cornerstone of Zero upon which all your other complementary habits are built. Here’s how it works.\n\nWhen you’ve recently eaten, your body grabs glucose for fuel, because it’s the most prevalent and easiest-to-burn substance on hand. Due to the aforementioned “modern” eating patterns, most people have more than enough glucose available from the meals, snacks, and beverages they consume to keep the proverbial “glucose fire” roaring most of the time.\n\nYour fast begins when you take your last bite of your last meal of the day. About 4 hours later, your body is finished burning or storing glucose from the food you ate and reaches for the next-easiest fuel source: glycogen, which is glucose stored in your liver and skeletal muscles. In order to shift into fat burning, you must burn through a significant proportion of your stored liver glycogen. If you start eating again before you’ve done that, you’re essentially staying on the “glucose treadmill” without ever tapping into your fat-burning reserves. (And you have a lot of reserves. Your body has 60 times more energy stored as fat than as glycogen!)\n\nAfter about 12 hours, your low glycogen stores signal to your body that you need a new primary fuel source — and this is when your body starts really reaching for fat. The reason fat is a “slower-burning energy” is because unlike glucose and glycogen, which readily burn within your cells, fat burning occurs one layer deeper, inside structures within your cells called mitochondria. This means that your body needs to break down stored fats into lipids (i.e., smaller units) and transport those lipids not just into the cells but into the cells’ mitochondria for combustion. All of the cellular machinery involved in this process gets better with use — and worse with disuse — so, if you want to be a great fat burner, you need to regularly signal the importance of fat burning to your body so it keeps this pipeline in pristine condition." },

High levels of blood glucose and insulin can result in serious health problems such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease; therefore, early and effective intervention is necessary.\n\nUnfortunately, high insulin levels are not just a symptom of PCOS — they’re also a major driver of the condition. High insulin levels can impair ovulation and cause the ovaries to make excess testosterone, which can increase the risk of menstrual-cycle dysfunction and exacerbate symptoms.\n\nRegularly allowing your body to spend time in the fasted state through intermittent fasting improves glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity. Intermittent fasting allows your body to switch into more of a “fat-burning mode” where you rely on your own body’s fatty acids and ketones for fuel, as opposed to glucose from the carbohydrates you consume.

One of the most common methods is to shorten your eating window each day, a strategy known as time-restricted feeding, or TRF.\n\nFor example, a 16:8 pattern means you fast for 16 hours and eat your food within an 8-hour window of time. You might do this by delaying or skipping breakfast or by eating an early dinner and forgoing late-night snacks. While by definition intermittent fasting means that you spend more time in the fasted state, the good news is that you can choose a period of time that is easily integrated into your normal day. Love having breakfast with your partner who often works late? Choose an earlier eating window. Or, if family dinners are the thing you just can’t do without, wait a few hours before having breakfast so that your first meal falls later in the day and your fasting window extends into the evening.\n\nAlternatively, you may find that fasting is not something you want to do every day, but you still want the benefits of intermittent fasting for PCOS. Some people find that alternate-day fasting (ADF) to be effective. In ADF, you toggle between one day of ad libitum (“normal”) eating and one day of either ordinary fasting or modified fasting where you lower your caloric intake by ~25% of your normal daily needs. (This latter option is typically intended for weight loss, so if that’s not your goal, stick to a gentler fast where you eat your full caloric allotment for the day.)\n\nWhichever intermittent fasting schedule you choose, the most important part of your intermittent fasting plan is consistency. However, a growing body of research indicates that at least some of the positive effects of TRF stem from aligning your food intake with your circadian rhythm. A typical circadian rhythm controls wakefulness across a 24-hour day. Late-night snacking can disrupt this natural rhythm, which can cause problems with sleep and healthy metabolic function. Aim to align your eating with daylight hours as much as possible, and end your eating window 2–4 hours before bed." },

The research is clear that protein intake is a crucial element to ensure the maintenance of lean body mass, which will not only support your weight-loss goals but is positively correlated with all sorts of things that “future you” will care about, such as reduced risk of falling and higher quality of life. Emphasizing protein in your Fast Breaker meal can help you minimize the initial blood-sugar spike that accompanies breaking a fast. Additionally, if you are finishing up a longer fast, such as an autophagy fast, which typically lasts 17–24 hours or longer, protein is especially important because it is used for cellular repair and reactivating the mTOR pathway, which regulates cell growth and protein synthesis and shuts down during fasts of 16 hours or more.\n\nNeed ideas for what to eat? Never fear! From Paleo to plant-based, there are plenty of delicious and healthy ways to break a fast that will support the benefits of your fasting practice.  (And if you really want to knock it out of the park, try including some physical activity just before your Fast Breaker so you can capitalize on your body’s fat-burning mode!)" },

To keep your body in a ketogenic state while breaking your fast, you’ll want to choose foods that are high in fat, very low in carbohydrate, and adequate in protein. Too much carbohydrate, or even too much protein, can be converted into glucose, making it difficult to maintain ketosis. Eggs or fattier cuts of pasture-raised meats, non-starchy vegetables cooked in healthy fats, and avocado make excellent go-tos." },

Plant-based eating of all forms has been linked to improvements in cardiovascular health, such as lower triglyceride levels and cholesterol.\n\nWhile too many raw vegetables can cause physical discomfort, like gas and bloating, fermented foods like sauerkraut, miso soup, or kimchi are easily digested powerhouses of microbiome health that can prevent or reduce GI distress. Fermented foods can further encourage the “good” bacteria to repopulate, as well.

After all, life is busy, and it can be tough to keep track of the important things — dentist appointments and friends’ birthdays, for example — nevermind painstakingly measuring each ingredient in your morning smoothie or trying to recall exactly how many hors d’oeuvres you had at last night’s party. When it comes down to it, counting calories can all feel a bit “much.”\n\nAlternatively, intermittent fasting is a straightforward, simple approach that has been shown to promote spontaneous caloric reduction and weight loss, and it comes with no calculator, no food scales, and no complicated dieting. Instead of focusing on tallying up calories from each and every bite you consume, intermittent fasting focuses only on when you eat. Yet, despite its simplicity, intermittent fasting is an effective approach that aligns with your body’s natural physiology to help you lose weight and improve your metabolic health." },
               { k: "section_title", v: "So, What’s the Verdict on Calorie Counting?" },
               { k: "desc", v: "First of all, what is a calorie? Most people think of calories as the nutritional value of a food, but in the truest sense, a calorie is simply a measure of energy. Specifically, a calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. Your body requires this energy for completing daily tasks, like running, breathing, and even thinking.\n\nHowever, despite this seemingly straightforward relationship, there are a number of reasons why counting calories long term is likely not a sustainable nor effective approach. Counting calories accurately is notoriously difficult and requires a tremendous amount of mental resources. Few people want to be bound to measuring spoons and food scales, yet differences in portion sizes or forgotten add-ons (like sauces, dressings, or cooking oils) can lead to measurement errors of hundreds of calories per day.\n\nNot to mention, it can be nearly impossible to know exact ingredients or serving sizes when eating out. Even if the energy content is listed on the menu or the back of a package label, it may not be entirely accurate; research has shown underestimates of between 8–200% for some commercially prepared foods. It’s also nearly impossible to track your calories in real time — you didn’t actually write down what was on your plate during that dinner party, did you? — and studies evaluating the accuracy of 24-hour diet recall show an average underestimation of 23–40%.\n\nAnd, lest you forget, tracking incoming calories is only one half of the equation. Yes, you burn calories during exercise, but for the majority of individuals (everyone except the hardcore athletes), your non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) — things like standing, washing dishes, and fidgeting — constitutes the majority of calories expended in a day. NEAT can vary dramatically day to day, and, since it doesn’t include purposeful movement, it’s virtually impossible to track. Your body will also reduce its basal metabolic rate — which controls things like hormone production, breathing rates, and temperature regulation — in response to caloric restriction. All this to say that it is nearly impossible to know with much accuracy or precision how many calories you are consuming or expending.\n\nBut, even with perfect knowledge, adhering to a reduced calorie diet is… well, TOUGH. Research shows that dietary adherence is strongly correlated to weight loss, but that it begins to wane at around -20% below maintenance levels — a level far above what is often recommended in popular reduced-calorie diets. Some research shows that weight loss recidivism rates are as high as 94% after 6 years, following traditional weight loss interventions.\n\nSo, while it may be a good idea to log food occasionally to get a more detailed picture of your overall diet quality and bring awareness to your hunger levels, dogmatically counting calories is typically a cumbersome, inaccurate, and unsustainable method of weight loss." },
               { k: "section_title", v: "Fasting vs. Calorie Counting" },
               { k: "desc", v: "Fasting offers an alternative to calorie counting that many find to be simple, effective, and more sustainable than traditional calorie counting. Unlike traditional diets, which are based on caloric restriction, intermittent fasting narrows the eating window but does not restrict what or how much you choose to eat.\n\nRecent research demonstrates that fasting is at least as effective in the short term as dieting in reducing weight, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. In the long-term, fasting enables sustainable weight loss — a 52-week observational study suggests time-restricted feeding is two times more effective in maintaining weight-loss success and avoiding weight regain. In addition, fasting provides benefits to your metabolic health that simply counting calories won’t target. Such benefits include…\n\nCell autophagy, an important cellular-waste removal process that can help protect against cancer, is activated in fasts longer than 16 hours.\nIncreased metabolic flexibility, or the ability to switch between using glucose and stored fats for fuel. Research shows that flipping this metabolic switch helps to mobilize fat in the form of free fatty acids and ketones, which may have benefits in the treatment of metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes.\nImproved brain health. Fasting promotes the release of BDNF, which encourages memory formation and protects against neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.\nFasting aligns with your body’s natural circadian rhythm, allowing you to take advantage of periods of naturally higher metabolic activity. Current studies on meal timing show that early fasting in particular can help lower blood sugar (glucose) levels, manage weight, and improve body composition.\nA fasting window is a prime moment of intentionality, where other habits, such as exercise, are amplified, thus accelerating things like weight loss." },
